# Board Game Wheel Spinner

A beautiful, interactive board game selector with wheel spinner animation, statistics tracking, and multi-device collaboration support.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Wheel Spinner**: Randomly select a board game with smooth animation
- **Confirm/Skip System**: Stats only count when you confirm the selection
- **Statistics Tracking**: Track games played, skipped, and never selected
- **Leaderboards**: View most played and never played games
- **Reroll Limits**: Limited rerolls per day (based on number of players)

### Data Management
- **Admin Panel**: Easy-to-use interface for managing games and players
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync data across devices using GitHub repository
- **LocalStorage**: Automatic local backup with fallback support
- **Session Codes**: Share session codes to collaborate across devices
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore your data

### Design
- **Board Game Arena Theme**: Blue, white, and orange color scheme
- **Desktop-Focused**: Optimized for desktop browsers
- **BoardGameGeek Images**: Automatic game image loading from BGG API
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on various screen sizes

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Select branch `main` (or your branch) as source
4. Save and wait for deployment
5. Access your app at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### 2. First Time Setup

1. Navigate to the **Admin** tab
2. Add players (affects daily reroll limit)
3. Games are pre-loaded, but you can add/remove them
4. Optionally configure GitHub sync for multi-device support

### 3. Start Spinning!

1. Go to the **Spinner** tab
2. Click "Spin the Wheel!"
3. When a game is selected, choose:
   - **Confirm**: Play this game (counts toward statistics)
   - **Skip**: Don't play this game (counts as skipped)
   - **Reroll**: Spin again (limited by daily reroll counter)

## How It Works

### Reroll System
- Daily reroll limit = Number of players in the system
- Counter resets every day at midnight
- Rerolls don't affect statistics

### Statistics
- **Games Played**: Only counts when you click "Confirm"
- **Games Skipped**: Only counts when you click "Skip"
- **Never Selected**: Games that have never been confirmed
- **Last Played**: Timestamp of last confirmation

### Data Storage

The app uses a three-tier storage approach:

1. **LocalStorage** (Primary): Data stored in browser
2. **GitHub Repository** (Sync): Optional cloud backup
3. **Session Codes**: Share data across devices

#### Setting Up GitHub Sync

**Option 1: Classic Personal Access Token (Recommended for simplicity)**

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Board Game Spinner")
   - Set expiration (recommend 90 days or No expiration for convenience)
   - **Required Permissions:**
     - âœ… **`repo`** - Full control of private repositories (if your repo is private)
     - OR âœ… **`public_repo`** - Access to public repositories only (if your repo is public)
   - Click "Generate token" and **copy it immediately** (you won't see it again!)

**Option 2: Fine-grained Personal Access Token (More secure)**

1. Create a fine-grained token:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Give it a descriptive name
   - Select "Only select repositories" and choose your kaiten repository
   - **Required Repository Permissions:**
     - âœ… **Contents: Read and write** - To create/update spinner-data.json
   - Click "Generate token" and **copy it immediately**

2. In the Admin panel:
   - Paste your token in "GitHub Personal Access Token"
   - Enter your repository as `username/repository-name` (e.g., `poysama/kaiten`)
   - Click "Save Settings"

3. Data will automatically sync to `spinner-data.json` in your repository whenever you:
   - Confirm or skip a game
   - Add/remove games or players
   - Click the sync button manually

#### Using Session Codes

Session codes allow multiple devices to share the same data:

1. On the first device:
   - Go to Admin > Session Settings
   - Enter a session code (e.g., "game-night-2024")
   - Click "Create Session"

2. On other devices:
   - Go to Admin > Session Settings
   - Enter the same session code
   - Click "Join Session"
   - Data will sync from GitHub

## Technical Details

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **APIs**:
  - GitHub REST API (data persistence)
  - BoardGameGeek XML API2 (game images)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages compatible

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- LocalStorage support required
- Canvas API support required

### File Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main application HTML
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css      # Board Game Arena themed styles
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js          # Application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ data.json       # Initial data structure
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # This file
```

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `styles.css` and modify the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
    --primary-blue: #2175d9;
    --primary-orange: #ff8c00;
    /* ... etc */
}
```

### Wheel Design

The wheel colors and design can be modified in `app.js` in the `drawWheel()` method:

```javascript
const colors = ['#2175d9', '#4a9eff', '#174d8a', '#5eb3ff'];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
- **Check BoardGameGeek ID**: Verify the BGG ID is correct for each game
  - Find BGG IDs at boardgamegeek.com - the number in the URL (e.g., `/boardgame/68448/` = ID 68448)
- **Internet Connection**: Images require active internet connection
- **CORS Proxy**: The app uses a CORS proxy (allorigins.win) to fetch BGG data
  - If allorigins.win is down, images won't load
  - Check browser console for errors
- **BGG API Rate Limits**: BoardGameGeek may rate-limit requests
  - Wait a few minutes and try again
  - Images are cached once loaded successfully

### GitHub Sync Not Working
- **Token Permissions**: Verify your token has the correct permissions
  - **Classic Token**: Needs `repo` (private) or `public_repo` (public)
  - **Fine-grained Token**: Needs `Contents: Read and write` permission
- **Repository Format**: Must be exactly `username/repository-name`
  - Example: `poysama/kaiten` (NOT `github.com/poysama/kaiten`)
- **Repository Access**: Ensure the token has access to the specified repository
  - For fine-grained tokens, check it's added to "Repository access"
- **File Permissions**: The app creates `spinner-data.json` in the root of your repo
  - Check if the file was created after first sync
- **Console Errors**: Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab for error details

### Data Lost
- Export data regularly as backup
- Use GitHub sync for automatic cloud backup
- Check browser's LocalStorage hasn't been cleared

## Privacy & Security

- All data stored locally in browser by default
- GitHub token stored in LocalStorage (use with caution)
- Never share your GitHub token publicly
- Use a dedicated token with minimal permissions
- Consider using a private repository for sensitive data
