# Vercel Setup Instructions - What You Need to Do

## Overview

Your app has been converted to use **Vercel + Redis** instead of GitHub for data storage. This is much better! Here's exactly what you need to do on your end.

## Part 1: Create Vercel Account (5 minutes)

1. **Sign up for Vercel** (completely free):
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
   - Sign up with GitHub (easiest option)
   - No credit card required!

2. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   - This will open a browser to authenticate
   - Click "Confirm" to authorize the CLI

## Part 2: Deploy Your App (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Make sure you're in your kaiten directory
cd /path/to/kaiten

# Deploy the app
vercel
```

**Answer the prompts:**
- `Set up and deploy "~/kaiten"?` â†’ **Y**
- `Which scope do you want to deploy to?` â†’ Select your account
- `Link to existing project?` â†’ **N**
- `What's your project's name?` â†’ **board-game-spinner** (or whatever you want)
- `In which directory is your code located?` â†’ **./` (just press Enter)
- `Want to override the settings?` â†’ **N**

Vercel will now deploy your app! You'll get a preview URL like:
```
https://board-game-spinner-abc123.vercel.app
```

### Step 2: Create Redis Database

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your project name (`board-game-spinner`)

2. **Create KV Database**:
   - Click on the **Storage** tab (top menu)
   - Click **Create Database**
   - Select **KV (Durable Redis)**
   - Give it a name: `spinner-db`
   - Choose region: Select the one closest to you
   - Click **Create**

3. **Link Database to Project**:
   - After creation, click **Connect Project**
   - Select your `board-game-spinner` project
   - Click **Connect**

   The environment variables will be automatically added to your project!

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy to production with the database linked
vercel --prod
```

This deploys your app with the Redis database connected!

You'll get your production URL:
```
https://board-game-spinner.vercel.app
```

**ðŸŽ‰ That's it! Your app is live with a real database backend!**

## Part 3: Using Your App

### Access Your App

Visit your production URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### First Time Setup

1. Go to the **Admin** tab
2. Add some players (e.g., "Alice", "Bob")
3. Your games should already be loaded from the initial data
4. Go to the **Spinner** tab and start spinning!

### Data Persistence

- Every time you confirm/skip a game, it automatically saves to Redis
- Your data is stored server-side (not in GitHub!)
- You can access it from any device using the same URL

### Multi-Device Sync

1. On **Device 1**:
   - Go to Admin â†’ Session Settings
   - Enter a code like "game-night-2024"
   - Click "Create Session"

2. On **Device 2**:
   - Open the same Vercel URL
   - Go to Admin â†’ Session Settings
   - Enter the same code: "game-night-2024"
   - Click "Join Session"

Both devices now share the same data!

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: API errors in console

**Solution**: Make sure you deployed with `vercel --prod` after creating the KV database.

### Problem: Data not saving

**Check:**
1. Vercel dashboard â†’ Your project â†’ Storage tab
2. Verify the KV database is created
3. Verify it's connected to your project
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

### Problem: "Module not found" errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## Updating Your App

Whenever you make changes:

```bash
# Option 1: Deploy to preview
vercel

# Option 2: Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Free Tier Limits

Vercel Free Tier includes:
- **Bandwidth**: 100 GB/month
- **Serverless Function Executions**: 100 GB-hours/month
- **KV Storage**: 256 MB
- **KV Read/Write Operations**: 30,000/month

**This is more than enough** for personal use and small groups!

## Benefits Over GitHub Approach

âœ… **Proper Database**: Redis is designed for this, GitHub is not
âœ… **No Token Issues**: No more GitHub token secret scanning errors
âœ… **Faster**: Direct database queries vs GitHub API calls
âœ… **More Reliable**: No CORS issues, no API rate limits
âœ… **Simpler**: Just works without complex GitHub setup
âœ… **Safer**: Data stored in a real database, not public repo

## What Changed in the Code

- âœ… Removed all GitHub API integration
- âœ… Added Vercel serverless API functions
- âœ… Connected to Vercel KV (Redis)
- âœ… Simplified data structure
- âœ… Better error handling
- âœ… Auto-sync on every change
